# Hi, I’m Aryaman Khadilkar.
## _Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I showcase my work, projects, and continuous learning journey in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Analytics._
<br><br>I am a Data Science enthusiast with a strong passion for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Analytics. I am deeply interested in exploring data to uncover hidden patterns, generate meaningful insights, and develop intelligent solutions that can solve real-world problems. My journey in data science is driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the desire to transform data into impactful outcomes.<br><br>Currently, I am working as a Data Science Intern at Cognifyz Technologies, where I am gaining hands-on experience in data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and applying machine learning concepts to practical projects. This experience is helping me strengthen both my technical foundation and problem-solving approach while working with real datasets and industry-relevant tools.<br><br>I primarily work with Python for data analysis and machine learning tasks, along with MySQL for database management and Power BI for data visualization and reporting. I enjoy building projects that combine analytical thinking with practical implementation, and I continuously focus on improving my skills in Machine Learning and Deep Learning through self-driven learning and experimentation.<br><br>My goal is to grow into a proficient Data Scientist by developing real-world solutions, contributing to meaningful projects, and continuously expanding my knowledge in emerging technologies within the data ecosystem. I am always open to collaboration, learning opportunities, and discussions related to data science, analytics, and innovative technologies.
